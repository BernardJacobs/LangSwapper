This plugin is aimed towards end users who enjoy playing games from another region (*cough* Japan *cough*) on the PSP. Well, mainly those who wish to 
keep the in-game HOME menu set to the language specified in the XMB Sytem Settings. Meaning, if you set your language to English, German, French, 
or anything else while playing a Japanese game, the in-game HOME menu will always be set to use that language.

As a bonus, the X/O buttons are automatically swapped at runtime. Meaning that X will always be ENTER and O will always be BACK. But wait, 
there's more. This also patches the Savedata Utility to use the language selected in the XMB as well and the buttons are swapped when loading/saving data.
